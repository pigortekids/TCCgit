## Deep Reinforcement Learning for financial trading using keras-rl

This code is part of the paper "Deep Reinforcement Learning for Financial Trading using Price Trailing" [[1]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8683161) presented at ICASSP 2019.

### Getting Started

Two models were developed in this project. 

The first model (Trail Environment) is our proposed method which is explained analytically the paper above. 

The second model (Deng_Environment) was based on the paper "Deep Direct Reinforcement Learning for Financial Signal Representation and Trading" [[2]](http://cslt.riit.tsinghua.edu.cn/mediawiki/images/a/aa/07407387.pdf) and was used to set a baseline to compare our results. For more information on how this model was used, please refer to our paper of ICASSP 2019.

For both approaches a DQN Agent as implemented in keras-rl [[3]](https://github.com/keras-rl/keras-rl) was used. The environment of the agent was built from scratch to provide a framework to a dataset of Forex exchange rates between two currencies.

### Prerequisites & Installation

I highly suggest using a virtual environment (e.g venv) to run this project.

The code is based mainly on the following packages:
- Python 2.7 / 3.5
- Tensorflow | see installation @ www.tensorflow.org/install/
- OpenAI Gym | pip install gym
- Keras + Keras-rl | pip install keras && keras-rl
- bokeh | pip install bokeh
- pandas | pip install pandas
- h5py | pip install h5py

To easily install all dependencies, run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*Note: if you are using python 2.7 then there is only one line of code you need to change to make it work and can be found within the environments file*

Python 2
```
for var, default in var_defaults.iteritems():
```

Python 3
```
for var, default in var_defaults.items():
```


### Hardware

The code can be run on a CPU or a GPU. You can also choose has much RAM and how many CPU cores to allocate when training a model. This allows multiple models to be trained in parallel. You can change the parameters in "dqn_agent.py"

```python
CPU = True  # Selection between CPU or GPU
CPU_cores = 2  # If CPU, how many cores
GPU_mem_use = 0.25  # In both cases the GPU mem is going to be used, choose fraction to use

```

Each epoch usually takes about ~7(GTX 750 ti)/14(i7-7700) seconds (depending on different variable settings). The models were trained on GTX 750ti 2GB GRAM, which usually would take anything from 30min to 2.5hr.

### Dataset

This project was trained and tested with data of US-Euro exchange rates collected over many years. Feel free to try different currencies. The form of the data should be in a usual time-series format as a numpy 1-D array with shape e.g (1000, ).

**Note:** A lot of data of exchange rates found online and are free, can sometimes be incomplete or in a bad format. Usually some preprocessing needs to be done in order to get good results.


### Execute

The structure should look likes this

    .
    ├── trading_agent           # Folder that contains an agent, an environment and code to calculate the PnL
    │   ├── dqn_agent.py            # Code of the agent to execute
    │   └── Environments            # The environments of the agent
    |
    ├── data                  # Folder that contains a train and a test dataset
    │   ├── train_data.npy          # Train data of exchange rates
    │   └── test_data.npy           # A different dataset containing exchange rates to test on
    └── ...

The file _Environment_ is a parent class that contains methods that are used by both environments or that should be implemented. The files *TrailEnv* and *DengEnv* extend this class and implement environment-specific methods. Currently, a method To choose between environments use this variable:

```
METHOD = trailing  # trailing or deng
```

Then simply move to the directory of the agent you want to run and execute:

```
python dqn_agent.py
```

Thanks to keras, you can also stop training whenever you like and the model will save its progress and weights!

### Results

For each model you create a new directory will be created containing many useful information, such as:
- ***agent_info.json***: The parameter values of the model
- ***model.json***: The model structure which you can load back to keras in the future
- ***memory.npy***: The history of the states of the agent
- ***weights_epoch_X.h5f***: The weights of the model in the best epoch
- Information regarding training e.g rewards, the trades the agent made, pnl
- A folder for each test dataset it was tested on

Additionally, a history of the agents trades will show up in your browser using the bokeh environment.
